##When to use

[![1](Screenshots/1.png)](Screenshots/1.png)

The main reason I created that app was because I was actually unable to find good free app where i can make my TODO lists whitout the risk of someone else to see them whitout paying to anyone even one cent. The limit is realy high (unreachable if you are not a bot ) and you can use it as much as you want whitout any problems.

* Supports almost all of the native languages
* Good looking
* Can be used on every Web browser
* Easy understandable
* Will be improved to be better for you when you give me some feedback

## Requirements ( if you want to fork and help me with the improvements )


* Ruby version - 1.9.3

* System dependencies - None

* Configuration - Check the gemfile

* Database creation - 2014.02.09
